HTTP, HTML and User Agents
The World Wide Web was built over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). 
A User Agent, like a web browser, uses HTTP to request a HTML document. The browser then formats and displays the document to its user.
HTTP is used to transport more the HTML, HTML from the browser to render the view.

##HTTP,HTML和客户端  
互联网是建立在超文本传输协议(HTTP)和超文本标记语言(HTML)之上。客户端，就像是一个网页浏览器，使用HTTP来请求一个HTML文件，之后，浏览器将HTML文件格式化后
，展示给用户看。HTTP是用来传输更多的HTML,HMTL从浏览器渲染成视图。  
如果你想学习HTML的相关知识，我们推荐由Dave Raggett编写的《Getting started with HTML》。  

The HTTP Request/Response cycle
A very important part of HTTP for the web developer is the request/response cycle. 
To use HTTP you have to make a request. An HTTP server, like a web server, is then obliged to respond. 
When you build your web application, you design it to react to an HTTP request by returning an HTTP response. 
Frameworks often abstract much of these nuts and bolts, but it is important to understand what is happening behind the scenes.
If you are not familiar with the HTTP request/response you should learn about it. 
There is a lot of help available in the internet, like How does the Internet work?

HTTP Request/Response周期  
request/response周期是开发者必看一个HTTP知识点。想要使用HTTP，你必须做出一个请求，接下来，HTTP服务（比如一个网页服务）就会做出响应。当你在构建自己的网页
应用时，你将它设计成，在接收到HTTP请求时，会返回一个HTTP响应。开发框架经常将这些细节抽象化，但了解这些场景背后到底发生了什么，仍是很重要的。如果你对HTTP 
请求/响应不是很了解，那就应该学习相关知识了。在网上，你可以获得喝多相关知识，比如 网络是如何运作的？
